## Drag and Drop Interface

This project features a drag-and-drop interface where users can reposition images within a grid of six divs. Each div represents a specific image and has been assigned a unique ID (`div1`, `div2`, etc.).

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Div Elements**: The interface includes 6 div elements with IDs from `div1` to `div6`. Each div is pre-assigned a background image via the `style.css` file.
- **Draggable & Droppable**: All six divs are both draggable and droppable, allowing users to rearrange the images in any desired pattern.
- **Image Swapping**: When a div is dragged and dropped into the position of another div, the content (images) of the two divs are swapped.
